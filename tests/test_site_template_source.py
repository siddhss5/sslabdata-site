"""Source-level checks on the Jekyll templates in site/.

These read the template text. They do not render Liquid and do not build the
site, so what they establish is that the templates ask for the star and for the
note, and that both are driven by the `equal_contribution` field rather than
being hard-coded — not that a built page shows them. Verifying rendered output
(HTML snapshots, internal links, accessibility) is siddhss5/labdata#36.

labdata's product is the data file; this repository is an example renderer
that consumes it, which is why these checks stay at the source level and pull
in nothing to render with.
